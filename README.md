Hello there!
I am Aashi, the Author of this script and I am updating it to support Maya 2023 and all previous Maya versions. 
Now, please note that the Add file is version01 while the file named Add_Attr_v0011 is actually version 1.1
The older file Add was made in Maya 2020 and hence may not work in the next Maya versions. For that you have to download version 1.1
Now this is essential because the method of loading the files is different for both scripts. The code that you have to paste in the Maya Script Editor has already been provided in the script. Just copy the file in your Maya Scripts Directory and paste the given code in your script editor. To make a button out of it, just drag it into your shelf Tab and choose Python. 
Making a button and saving it in the Shelf like this will allow you to use it again and again without writing the entire code. 
I hope this proves to be useful.
Thank you!
